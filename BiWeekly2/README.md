- WEEKLY CHALLENGE(Week 2)

Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
~ Zen of python

This coding exercise is to test your knowledge on what you have learnt so far. You are free to use the internet and any other libraries.
Objective: Build a regressor that recommends the crew member size for potential ship buyers. 
Data

Please do the following steps (hint: use numpy, scipy, pandas, sklearn)
1. Read the file and display columns.
2. Calculate basic statistics of the data (count, mean, std, etc) and examine data and state your  observations.
3. Select columns that will be probably important to predict crew size.
 Create training and testing sets (use 60% of the data for the training and reminder for testing).
4. Build a machine learning model to predict the crew size.
5. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient for the training set and testing data sets.
6. Explain Overfitting, and How Can You Avoid It? 
7. Whatâ€™s the difference between bias and variance?
8. When Will You Use Classification over Regression?

Remark: This is an example of a very straightforward problem. The dataset is clean and small (160 rows and 9 columns), and the instructions are very clear. What is needed is to follow the instructions and generate your code.

Good luck!
